# SocalBeach4Life

Welcome to SocalBeach4Life, the easiest way to find beaches nearby.

## Running Instructions

1. For best usage, use an Android emulator with GOOGLE APIs enabled and API level 31. Recommend device is Pixel 3a XL API 31. (The app will show a message saying Google Play Services are not installed if using an emulator without GOOGLE APIs). We do not recommend using API 33, as the latest version is susceptible to glitches with the older Google Maps SDK.
2. Unzip the source code and open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app.
4. In case the app is stuck loading when loading the beaches map after logging in, try restarting the app.
